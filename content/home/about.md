# Biography

I am a 2nd-year Computer Science PhD student at UT Austin, where I work with my adviser [Işıl Dillig](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) in the [UTOPIA Research Group](http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu). 

My research focuses on combining machine learning and AI with programming language techniques. In particular, I am interested in tackling challenging tasks that require reasoning about discrete and abstract mathematical objects (e.g., programs, logical formulas, and type systems). 
 
So far, my colleagues and I have applied evolutionary algorithms to synthesizing input patterns that trigger program worst-case behaviors, reinforcement learning to synthesizing proofs about relational program properties, and currently, graph neural networks to infer type annotations for gradually typed programs.


Before joining UTOPIA, I received my bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China.
